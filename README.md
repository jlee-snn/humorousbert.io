## MIDS UC Berkeley w210: Humorous Bot Study

### Introduction

The purpose of this project is to build model architecture for detecting humor and examining how encoders such as ALBERT learn humor.

### Academic Approach Has 3 Primary Objectives
- Maximize model’s understanding of humor
  - One recent paper achieved an F1 of [.72,.98], but with much less data
-Explore model performance with different types / subsets of humor
  - i.e. are puns really hard to understand relative to other jokes?
- Develop methods to explore how the model is understanding humor
- Explore the transformed embeddings of jokes (jokes vs. not jokes, etc.)
- Can we create a tool or potential product from exposing NLP encodings to data scientists?
- Review humor theory for understanding of humor and improving model performance

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jlee-snn/humorousbert.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
