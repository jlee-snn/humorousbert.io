## MIDS UC Berkeley w210: Humorous Bot Study

### Introduction
Given the exponential rate of growth of user created data, it is important to consider ways to automatically detect specific information. Our team is interested in exploring and understanding how specifically humorous content can be detected and created using deep learning based means. Furthermore, our team has shifted focus on understanding the mechanisms of training encoders with humorous text.  The purpose of this project is to build model architecture for detecting humor and examining how encoders such as ALBERT learn humor.


### Academic Approach Has 3 Primary Objectives
- Maximize model’s understanding of humor
  - One recent paper achieved an F1 of [.72,.98], but with much less data
-Explore model performance with different types / subsets of humor
  - i.e. are puns really hard to understand relative to other jokes?
- Develop methods to explore how the model is understanding humor
- Explore the transformed embeddings of jokes (jokes vs. not jokes, etc.)
- Can we create a tool or potential product from exposing NLP encodings to data scientists?
- Review humor theory for understanding of humor and improving model performance

### Model Performance

### Text Generation

The following texts were poorly generated jokes using general jokes dataset:
- Hello I I'm going to sell my theremin I'm really tempted
- Hello there! My name is David. I'm not a robot. I just don't like it when people call me David. Do you want me to say David? No
- Hello there's a twelve-year-old in the front seat. Happy Fourth of July."""
- Hello there. You are not the boss of the people under your bed."""
- What's a pirate's favorite letter? Because the letter R is used to write 'a' in the English language.
- What do you call an Irishman who is happy on a Monday? Job done.

The following texts were good jokes generated by the model using a dataset of puns:
- he was trying to get a point across but the speaker was always missing
- he took a shot at new opportunities
- to find bargains go where the auction is
- those who live beyond their means should act their wage
- this diet is wearing me thin
- the young pine sapling was admonished by his father apparently he d been knotty
- they met in cooking class it was boil meets grill
- they called him the king of the dentists because he specialized in crowns
- they argued about their vacation and finally stayed at the last resort
- the violinist spent the night in a vile inn

The model is clearly able to recognize the pattern of puns better than for jokes.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/jlee-snn/humorousbert.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
